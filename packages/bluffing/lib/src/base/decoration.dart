/// An immutable description of how to paint a box.
///
/// The [BoxDecoration] class provides a variety of ways to draw a box.
///
/// The box has a [border], a body, and may cast a [boxShadow].
///
/// The [shape] of the box can be a circle or a rectangle. If it is a rectangle,
/// then the [borderRadius] property controls the roundness of the corners.
///
/// The body of the box is painted in layers. The bottom-most layer is the
/// [color], which fills the box. Above that is the [gradient], which also fills
/// the box. Finally there is the [image], the precise alignment of which is
/// controlled by the [DecorationImage] class.
///
/// The [border] paints over the body; the [boxShadow], naturally, paints below it.
///
/// {@tool sample}
///
/// The following applies a [BoxDecoration] to a [Container] widget to draw an
/// [image] of an owl with a thick black [border] and rounded corners.
///
/// ![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/box_decoration.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// Container(
///   decoration: BoxDecoration(
///     color: const Color(0xff7c94b6),
///     image: const DecorationImage(
///       image: NetworkImage('https:///flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/owl-2.jpg'),
///       fit: BoxFit.cover,
///     ),
///     border: Border.all(
///       color: Colors.black,
///       width: 8,
///     ),
///     borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
